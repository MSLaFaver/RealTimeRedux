Redux requires the following DLL files to be able to build. These are not required to use the mod; please download and unzip the latest release in your game directory to use it.

These are required if you are building the mod from its source. You should be able to get them from MelonLoader and some Il2Cpp dumping utility (such as Unity Explorer). The only exception is `NVorbis.dll`, which requires you to install the NVorbis NuGet package or find the `.dll` elsewhere.

Place these files in a `\\lib` folder so Visual Studio can find them.

* 0Harmony.dll
* Assembly-CSharp.dll
* Il2CppInterop.Runtime.dll
* Il2Cppmscorlib.dll
* MelonLoader.dll
