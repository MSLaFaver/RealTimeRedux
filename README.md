# _Five Nights at Freddy's: In Real Time >Redux_
An overhaul mod to return the game to its original premise - a remake of _Five Nights at Freddy's_ with live, moving animatronics. No changed story. No extra content.

# How to Run
1. Download and unzip _[Five Nights at Freddy's: In Real Time](https://gamejolt.com/games/realtimefnaf/832545)_ (which requires you to own [the original game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/319510/Five_Nights_at_Freddys) on Steam and have Steam running).
2. Download the latest version of [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe).
3. Open the installer. If you have not run it before, select "Add Game Manually" and select the `.exe` for _In Real Time_. You can then select the game from the searchable list.
4. Keep the default settings and select "Install." Close the installer when complete.
5. Run the game once. A console should appear. Close once you see the GameJolt logo.
6. Download the latest release of _Redux_: [Latest](https://github.com/MSLaFaver/RealTimeRedux/releases/latest)
7. Unzip _Redux_ to the directory where you installed _In Real Time_. You should now have a folder called `MSLaFaver-Redux` inside your `Mods` folder.
8. You can now play _Five Nights at Freddy's: In Real Time >Redux_.

Note: To play the game without the MelonLoader console, create a shortcut to the `.exe` (right click -> "Show more options" -> Create shortcut). Rename and place it wherever you want. Right click on the shortcut and append `--melonloader.hideconsole` to the `Target` field.
